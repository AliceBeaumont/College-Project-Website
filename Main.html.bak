		<p>Youth's Truth Charity Trust is an organisation designed to help the trans youth of today to both learn more about themselves as well as gain help in becoming their authentic self, regardless of situation. We aim to provide clothing, funding for medical changes such as HRT, as well as potential foster homes for youths who live in an unsafe environment. With your help we would be able to help potential hundreds of young trans people in both the local area as well as nationally to have a better chance at becoming who they really are as well as helping to provide potentially life saving gender-affirming treatment.</p>
